# Rest API

Develop Rest API, store data in DynamoDB, and build a React front end.

Examples:
* get-groups
  - This is a GET request that fetches all image groups in chunks
  - limit and nextKey are used as parameters
* create-group
  - This is a POST request that adds a new image group to the database
  - No parameters are used
